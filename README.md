# Code_Refactor Version 2



## Description

<!-- Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide: -->

For this project, the goal was to take the original HTML and CSS code and optimize it. 

Optimization would be complete if the elements flowed correctly, semantic tags in HTML were used correctly, and efficient CSS was utilized. 

There are also comments in the code that I included to show my thought process, and so that future developers could interpret the code. 

 I first pulled a copy of the source code from a repository using Git Clone, then copied that directory into my own folder. To set up the ideal folder structure, I used the terminal to create an index.html file, and an assets folder, along with a style folder. 

Next, I created several commits, using the correct git version control standard (adding, committing, and pushing those changes back to the main branch)

Finally, the end goal was to successfully deploy it via Github pages.
